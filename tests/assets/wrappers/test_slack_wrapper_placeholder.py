Placeholder for Slack wrapper tests.

The original Slack wrapper test had import errors due to missing dependencies:
- test_slack_bolt_wrapper.py

This test requires slack-bolt and slack-sdk dependencies that cause issues in CI.
They are currently skipped using @pytest.mark.skip decorators.

TODO: Implement proper Slack wrapper tests in future Slack implementation story.
