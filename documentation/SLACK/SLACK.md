### Deployment Parameters

The Slack integration stack requires the following parameters during deployment:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Format | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|---------|
| `slackBotToken` | Slack Bot User OAuth Token | String | Yes | `xoxb-[0-9]+-[0-9]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+` | `xoxb-NUMBERS-NUMBERS-ALPHANUMERIC` |
| `slackSigningSecret` | Slack App Signing Secret for webhook verification | String | Yes | 32 hexadecimal characters | `a1b2c3d4e5f6...` |
| `slackWorkspaceId` | Slack Workspace ID | String | Yes | `[A-Z0-9]{9,11}` | `T1234567890` |
| `logLevel` | Log level for Lambda functions | String | No | `info`, `debug`, or `error` | `error` (default) |

**Parameter Validation**: The deployment script validates all parameters using CloudFormation constraints to ensure they match the required formats before deployment.

### Deployment Process

The deployment script performs the following steps:

1. **Validates Parameters**: Checks that all required parameters are provided and match the expected formats
2. **Deploys Common Stack**: Creates shared resources (EventBridge, DynamoDB, Lambda layers)
3. **Deploys Slack Stack**: Creates Slack-specific resources (Lambda functions, API Gateway, IAM roles)
4. **Creates SSM Parameters**: Stores credentials securely in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
5. **Configures Permissions**: Sets up IAM roles with least-privilege access
6. **Outputs Configuration**: Displays the API Gateway endpoint URL for Slack configuration

### Expected Output

After successful deployment, you'll see:

```
✅ Slack integration deployed successfully!

🔍 Running deployment verification...

📝 Next steps:
   1. Configure your Slack app's Event Subscriptions URL with the API Gateway endpoint
   2. Configure your Slack app's Slash Commands with the /security-ir command
   3. Install the Slack app to your workspace
   4. Test the integration by creating a test AWS Security IR case
```

**Note**: The deployment includes automatic verification unless you use `--skip-verification`. The verification script checks all deployed resources and provides a comprehensive status report.

### Integration Flow

There are two bidirectional flows in the integration between Slack and AWS Security Incident Response (SIR).

#### Flow 1: AWS Security Incident Response to Slack

1. The **Security IR Poller Lambda** (from common stack) periodically polls for incidents generated by SIR
2. It stores the incident details in DynamoDB and publishes Create, Update, or Delete events to EventBridge
3. The **Slack Client Lambda** subscribes to these EventBridge events via the `slack-client-rule`
4. For new cases, it creates a dedicated Slack channel using the Slack Bolt framework and stores the `slackChannelId` in DynamoDB
5. For updates, it queries DynamoDB for the `slackChannelId` and posts updates to the specific channel
6. It syncs comments, attachments, and status changes to the Slack channel with duplicate detection

#### Flow 2: Slack to AWS Security Incident Response

1. Users post messages or use slash commands in Slack incident channels
2. Slack sends webhook events to **API Gateway** (`/slack/events` endpoint)
3. **API Gateway** routes events to the **Slack Events Bolt Handler Lambda**
4. The Bolt Handler processes events using the Slack Bolt framework:
   - User messages are synced to AWS SIR as case comments with `[Slack Update]` tag
   - Channel membership changes are tracked and logged
   - File uploads are downloaded and synced as attachments (with size limits)
   - Slash commands are routed asynchronously to the **Slack Command Handler Lambda**
5. The **Slack Command Handler Lambda** executes AWS SIR API operations (status updates, case modifications)
6. Results are posted back to the Slack channel using response URLs

## Resources

### AWS Resources

The Slack integration stack creates the following AWS resources:

#### Lambda Functions

1. **Slack Client Lambda** (`SecurityIncidentResponseSlackClient`)
   - Processes events from AWS Security Incident Response via EventBridge
   - Creates Slack channels for new incidents using Slack Bolt framework
   - Posts updates, comments, and attachments to Slack with exponential backoff retry
   - Handles bidirectional comment and attachment synchronization
   - Timeout: 15 minutes (for large attachment downloads)
   - Memory: 512 MB
   - Runtime: Python 3.13

2. **Slack Events Bolt Handler Lambda** (`SlackEventsBoltHandler`)
   - Processes all Slack events using Slack Bolt framework
   - Handles messages, channel events, file uploads, and member changes
   - Routes slash commands asynchronously to Command Handler
   - Performs Slack signature verification for security
   - Timeout: 30 seconds (Slack requirement)
   - Memory: 512 MB
   - Runtime: Python 3.13

3. **Slack Command Handler Lambda** (`SlackCommandHandler`)

  - REST API endpoint for Slack webhooks
  - Path: `/slack/events`
  - Handles Event Subscriptions and Slash Commands
  - Configured with CORS, throttling (100 req/sec, 200 burst), and access logging
  - Signature verification handled in Lambda (not API Gateway)
  - CloudWatch Logs integration with 1-week retention

#### EventBridge Rules

1. **Slack Client Rule** (`slack-client-rule`)
   - Captures events from AWS Security Incident Response (source: `security-ir`)
   - Triggers the Slack Client Lambda
   - Event pattern: CaseCreated, CaseUpdated, CommentAdded, AttachmentAdded

2. **Slack Notifications Rule** (`SlackNotificationsRule`)
   - Captures events from Slack Events Handler (source: `slack`)
   - Logs events to CloudWatch for monitoring and debugging
   - Helps track bidirectional sync operations

#### SSM Parameters

- `/SecurityIncidentResponse/slackBotToken` (SecureString)
- `/SecurityIncidentResponse/slackSigningSecret` (SecureString)
- `/SecurityIncidentResponse/slackWorkspaceId` (String)

#### IAM Roles

- Custom roles for each Lambda function with least privilege permissions
- Specific SSM parameter access per function
- EventBridge publish permissions
- DynamoDB read/write permissions

#### DynamoDB Table

- Uses a shared table from the common stack to store incident-to-channel mapping
- Schema includes `slackChannelId`, `slackChannelCaseDescription`, `slackChannelCaseTitle`, etc.

#### Lambda Layers

1. **Domain Layer**: Shared domain models and data structures for incident management
2. **Mappers Layer**: Data transformation logic between AWS SIR and Slack formats
3. **Wrappers Layer**: Slack Bolt framework wrapper with common functionality
4. **Slack Bolt Layer**: Slack SDK and Bolt framework dependencies (slack-bolt, slack-sdk)

All layers are compatible with Python 3.13 runtime and shared across Lambda functions for consistency.

## Available Slash Commands

The `/security-ir` command supports the following subcommands:

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `status` | Get current case status and details | `/security-ir status` | Returns case ID, status, severity, title |
| `update-status` | Update case status | `/security-ir update-status <status>` | `/security-ir update-status Resolved` |
| `update-description` | Update case description | `/security-ir update-description <text>` | `/security-ir update-description Updated findings` |
| `update-title` | Update case title | `/security-ir update-title <text>` | `/security-ir update-title Critical Security Issue` |
| `close` | Close the case | `/security-ir close` | Closes the case and updates channel |
| `incident-details` | Get incident details | `/security-ir incident-details` | Returns details with key information |

**Note**: All commands must be used within an incident channel (channel name starts with `aws-security-incident-response-case-`).

## Features

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting information, please refer to the [Slack Troubleshooting Guide](SLACK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Quick Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Slack channel not created for new case
- Check Slack Client Lambda logs in CloudWatch
- Verify bot token is valid
- Ensure bot has `channels:manage` permission

**Issue**: Messages not syncing from Slack to AWS SIR
- Verify Event Subscriptions URL is configured correctly
- Check Slack Events Bolt Handler Lambda logs
- Ensure bot is a member of the channel

**Issue**: Slash commands not working
- Verify slash command is configured with correct Request URL
- Check Slack Command Handler Lambda logs
- Ensure command is used in an incident channel

## Security Considerations

- All credentials stored securely in SSM Parameter Store with encryption
- IAM roles follow principle of least privilege
- Slack request signature verification for all webhooks
- API Gateway rate limiting and request validation
- CloudWatch logging enabled for all Lambda functions
- No sensitive data logged (tokens, passwords, PII)
- Regular credential rotation recommended (every 90 days)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How long does it take for changes to sync between systems?**  
A: Changes typically sync within seconds. The integration uses event-driven architecture to ensure near real-time updates.

**Q: Can I customize the channel naming convention?**  
A: Yes, you can modify the channel prefix by updating the SSM parameter `/SecurityIncidentResponse/slackChannelPrefix`.

**Q: What happens if the integration fails?**  
A: The integration includes error handling and dead-letter queues. Failed events are stored and can be reprocessed. CloudWatch alarms will notify you of failures.

**Q: Can I use this with Slack Enterprise Grid?**  
A: Yes, the integration supports Slack Enterprise Grid. Use the workspace ID of the specific workspace you want to integrate with.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What permissions are required in Slack?**  
A: The bot needs permissions to create channels, send messages, read messages, manage files, and read user information. See the "Creating a Slack App" section for the complete list.

**Q: How are credentials stored?**  
A: Slack credentials are stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as SecureString parameters with KMS encryption. Bot tokens and signing secrets are validated during deployment and accessed securely by Lambda functions.

**Q: Can I deploy multiple integrations to different Slack workspaces?**  
A: Yes, you can deploy the stack multiple times with different parameters to connect to different Slack workspaces.

**Q: How do I rotate Slack credentials?**  
A: Use the parameter rotation script: `python scripts/slack_parameter_setup.py rotate --bot-token <new-token> --signing-secret <new-secret> --workspace-id <workspace-id>`. The script validates formats and updates all SSM parameters atomically. See the [Parameter Management Guide](SLACK_PARAMETER_MANAGEMENT.md) for details.
