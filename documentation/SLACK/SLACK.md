# AWS Security Incident Response Slack Integration

This document provides an overview of the AWS Security Incident Response Slack integration, including its architecture, deployment, configuration, and usage.

## Overview

The Slack integration for AWS Security Incident Response enables bidirectional communication between AWS Security Incident Response and Slack. This allows security incidents to be synchronized between both systems in real-time, with dedicated Slack channels created for each incident.

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the Slack integration, you need:

1. **Slack Workspace**: Admin access to a Slack workspace
2. **Slack App**: A Slack app configured with the required permissions
3. **AWS Account**: Permissions to deploy CloudFormation stacks and create AWS resources
4. **Python 3.x**: For running the deployment script
5. **AWS CDK**: Installed and configured (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)

### Creating a Slack App

1. **Create a New Slack App**:
   - Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
   - Click "Create New App"
   - Select "From scratch"
   - Enter an app name (e.g., "AWS Security IR Integration")
   - Select your workspace
   - Click "Create App"

2. **Configure OAuth & Permissions**:
   - In the left sidebar, click "OAuth & Permissions"
   - Scroll to "Scopes" section
   - Add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:
     - `channels:manage` - Create and manage channels
     - `channels:read` - View basic channel information
     - `chat:write` - Send messages as the bot
     - `files:read` - View files shared in channels
     - `files:write` - Upload files to channels
     - `users:read` - View users in the workspace
     - `users:read.email` - View user email addresses
     - `channels:join` - Join public channels
     - `groups:read` - View private channel information
     - `groups:write` - Manage private channels
     - `im:read` - View direct messages
     - `mpim:read` - View group direct messages
     - `commands` - Add slash commands

3. **Install App to Workspace**:
   - Scroll to the top of the "OAuth & Permissions" page
   - Click "Install to Workspace"
   - Review the permissions and click "Allow"
   - **Copy the "Bot User OAuth Token"** (starts with `xoxb-`)
   - Save this token securely - you'll need it for deployment

4. **Get Signing Secret**:
   - In the left sidebar, click "Basic Information"
   - Scroll to "App Credentials"
   - **Copy the "Signing Secret"**
   - Save this secret securely - you'll need it for deployment

5. **Get Workspace ID**:
   - In your Slack workspace, click on the workspace name in the top-left
   - Select "Settings & administration" > "Workspace settings"
   - The Workspace ID is shown in the URL: `https://app.slack.com/client/T1234567890/...`
   - The ID starts with `T` (e.g., `T1234567890`)

### Deployment Command

Use the deployment script to deploy the Slack integration:

```bash
./deploy-integrations-solution.py slack --help
```

You should see the following output:

```
usage: deploy-integrations-solution slack [-h] --bot-token BOT_TOKEN --signing-secret SIGNING_SECRET --workspace-id WORKSPACE_ID [--log-level {info,debug,error}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --bot-token BOT_TOKEN
                        Slack Bot User OAuth Token (xoxb-...)
  --signing-secret SIGNING_SECRET
                        Slack App Signing Secret
  --workspace-id WORKSPACE_ID
                        Slack Workspace ID
  --log-level {info,debug,error}
                        Log level for Lambda functions
```

Deploy the integration with a single command:

```bash
./deploy-integrations-solution.py slack \
  --bot-token "xoxb-YOUR-BOT-TOKEN-HERE" \
  --signing-secret "YOUR-SIGNING-SECRET-HERE" \
  --workspace-id "T1234567890" \
  --log-level error
```

### Deployment Parameters

The Slack integration stack requires the following parameters during deployment:

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required | Format | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------|--------|---------|
| `slackBotToken` | Slack Bot User OAuth Token | String | Yes | `xoxb-[0-9]+-[0-9]+-[a-zA-Z0-9]+` | `xoxb-NUMBERS-NUMBERS-ALPHANUMERIC` |
| `slackSigningSecret` | Slack App Signing Secret for webhook verification | String | Yes | 64 hexadecimal characters | `a1b2c3d4e5f6...` |
| `slackWorkspaceId` | Slack Workspace ID | String | Yes | `[A-Z0-9]{9,11}` | `T1234567890` |
| `logLevel` | Log level for Lambda functions | String | No | `info`, `debug`, or `error` | `error` (default) |

**Parameter Validation**: The deployment script validates all parameters using CloudFormation constraints to ensure they match the required formats before deployment.

### Deployment Process

The deployment script performs the following steps:

1. **Validates Parameters**: Checks that all required parameters are provided and match the expected formats
2. **Deploys Common Stack**: Creates shared resources (EventBridge, DynamoDB, Lambda layers)
3. **Deploys Slack Stack**: Creates Slack-specific resources (Lambda functions, API Gateway, IAM roles)
4. **Creates SSM Parameters**: Stores credentials securely in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
5. **Configures Permissions**: Sets up IAM roles with least-privilege access
6. **Outputs Configuration**: Displays the API Gateway endpoint URL for Slack configuration

### Expected Output

After successful deployment, you'll see:

```
✅ Slack integration deployed successfully!

📝 Next steps:
   1. Configure your Slack app's Event Subscriptions URL with the API Gateway endpoint
   2. Configure your Slack app's Slash Commands with the /security-ir command
   3. Install the Slack app to your workspace
   4. Test the integration by creating a test AWS Security IR case
```

### Integration Flow

There are two bidirectional flows in the integration between Slack and AWS Security Incident Response (SIR).

#### Flow 1: AWS Security Incident Response to Slack

1. The **Security IR Poller Lambda** periodically polls for incidents generated by SIR
2. It stores the incident details in DynamoDB and publishes Create, Update, or Delete events to EventBridge
3. The **Slack Client Lambda** subscribes to these EventBridge events
4. For new cases, it creates a dedicated Slack channel and stores the `slackChannelId` in DynamoDB
5. For updates, it queries DynamoDB for the `slackChannelId` and posts updates to the specific channel
6. It syncs comments, attachments, and status changes to the Slack channel

#### Flow 2: Slack to AWS Security Incident Response

1. Users post messages or use slash commands in Slack incident channels
2. Slack sends webhook events to **API Gateway**
3. **API Gateway** routes events to the **Slack Events Bolt Handler Lambda**
4. The Bolt Handler processes events:
   - User messages are synced to AWS SIR as case comments
   - Channel membership changes are logged as system comments
   - File uploads are synced as attachments
   - Slash commands are routed to the **Slack Command Handler Lambda**
5. The **Slack Command Handler Lambda** executes AWS SIR API operations
6. Results are posted back to the Slack channel

## Resources

2. **Mappers Layer**: Slack data transformation logic
3. **Wrappers Layer**: Slack Bolt framework wrapper
4. **Slack Bolt Layer**: Slack SDK and Bolt framework dependencies

## Available Slash Commands

The `/security-ir` command supports the following subcommands:

| Command | Description | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `status` | Get current case status and details | `/security-ir status` | Returns case ID, status, severity, title |
| `update-status` | Update case status | `/security-ir update-status <status>` | `/security-ir update-status Resolved` |
| `update-description` | Update case description | `/security-ir update-description <text>` | `/security-ir update-description Updated findings` |
| `update-title` | Update case title | `/security-ir update-title <text>` | `/security-ir update-title Critical Security Issue` |
| `close` | Close the case | `/security-ir close` | Closes the case and updates channel |
| `summarize` | Get case summary | `/security-ir summarize` | Returns summary with key events |

**Note**: All commands must be used within an incident channel (channel name starts with `aws-security-incident-response-case-`).

## Features

### Automatic Channel Creation

- Dedicated channel created for each AWS Security IR case
- Channel naming: `aws-security-incident-response-case-<caseId>`
- Case watchers automatically added to channel
- Initial notification with case details posted

### Bidirectional Comment Sync

- User messages in Slack sync to AWS SIR as case comments
- Comments in AWS SIR sync to Slack as messages
- User attribution preserved
- Duplicate detection prevents loops

### Attachment Synchronization

- Files uploaded to Slack channels sync to AWS SIR
- Attachments added to AWS SIR sync to Slack
- File metadata preserved (filename, type, size)
- Size limit handling with appropriate notifications

### Channel Membership Tracking

- System comments added when users join/leave channels
- Tagged with `[Slack Update]` to prevent notification loops
- Includes user name and timestamp

### Error Handling

- Exponential backoff retry logic for all Slack operations
- Failed operations logged as system comments in AWS SIR
- Dead-letter queues for failed events
- CloudWatch alarms for monitoring

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting information, please refer to the [Slack Troubleshooting Guide](SLACK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Quick Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Slack channel not created for new case
- Check Slack Client Lambda logs in CloudWatch
- Verify bot token is valid
- Ensure bot has `channels:manage` permission

**Issue**: Messages not syncing from Slack to AWS SIR
- Verify Event Subscriptions URL is configured correctly
- Check Slack Events Bolt Handler Lambda logs
- Ensure bot is a member of the channel

**Issue**: Slash commands not working
- Verify slash command is configured with correct Request URL
- Check Slack Command Handler Lambda logs
- Ensure command is used in an incident channel

## Security Considerations

- All credentials stored securely in SSM Parameter Store with encryption
- IAM roles follow principle of least privilege
- Slack request signature verification for all webhooks
- API Gateway rate limiting and request validation
- CloudWatch logging enabled for all Lambda functions
- No sensitive data logged (tokens, passwords, PII)
- Regular credential rotation recommended (every 90 days)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How long does it take for changes to sync between systems?**  
A: Changes typically sync within seconds. The integration uses event-driven architecture to ensure near real-time updates.

**Q: Can I customize the channel naming convention?**  
A: Yes, you can modify the channel prefix by updating the SSM parameter `/SecurityIncidentResponse/slackChannelPrefix`.

**Q: What happens if the integration fails?**  
A: The integration includes error handling and dead-letter queues. Failed events are stored and can be reprocessed. CloudWatch alarms will notify you of failures.

**Q: Can I use this with Slack Enterprise Grid?**  
A: Yes, the integration supports Slack Enterprise Grid. Use the workspace ID of the specific workspace you want to integrate with.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What permissions are required in Slack?**  
A: The bot needs permissions to create channels, send messages, read messages, manage files, and read user information. See the "Creating a Slack App" section for the complete list.

**Q: How are credentials stored?**  
A: Slack credentials are stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store as SecureString parameters with KMS encryption.

**Q: Can I deploy multiple integrations to different Slack workspaces?**  
A: Yes, you can deploy the stack multiple times with different parameters to connect to different Slack workspaces.

**Q: How do I rotate Slack credentials?**  
A: Use the parameter rotation script: `python scripts/slack_parameter_setup.py rotate --bot-token <new-token> --signing-secret <new-secret> --workspace-id <workspace-id>`. See the [Parameter Management Guide](SLACK_PARAMETER_MANAGEMENT.md) for details.
