## Setup and Configuration

1. **Prepare ServiceNow**:
   - Ensure you have a ServiceNow instance with admin access
   - Create a dedicated service account for the integration if needed

2. **Deploy the Stack**:
   ```bash
   # Using the deploy-integrations-solution script
   deploy-integrations-solution service-now \
     --instance-id <your-servicenow-instance-id> \
     --username <your-servicenow-username> \
     --password <your-servicenow-password> \
     --log-level info
   ```
   
   Note: The `--log-level` parameter is optional and defaults to `error`. Valid values are `info`, `debug`, and `error`.

3. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - The ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda will automatically:
     - Create business rules in ServiceNow to detect incident changes
     - Configure outbound REST messages to send data to the API Gateway
     - Set up the webhook URL in ServiceNow

4. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Check CloudFormation outputs for the webhook URL
   - Verify in ServiceNow that the business rules and outbound REST messages were created
   - The business rules will be prefixed with the Lambda function name for easy identification

5. **Test the Integration**:
   - Create a test incident in ServiceNow
   - Verify that the incident appears in AWS Security Incident Response
   - Update the incident in AWS and verify the changes appear in ServiceNow

## Outputs and Validation

After deploying the stack, you'll receive CloudFormation outputs that can be used to validate and troubleshoot the integration.

### Using CloudFormation Outputs

#### ServiceNowClientLambdaArn

This output provides the ARN of the ServiceNow Client Lambda function.

**How to use it for validation:**

1. **Verify Lambda Function Existence:**
   ```bash
   aws lambda get-function --function-name <ServiceNowClientLambdaArn>
   ```

2. **Check Lambda Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Get the function name from the ARN
   FUNCTION_NAME=$(echo <ServiceNowClientLambdaArn> | cut -d':' -f7)
   aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/$FUNCTION_NAME" --limit 10
   ```

3. **Monitor Function Invocations:**
   - Navigate to the Lambda console
   - Search for the function using the ARN
   - Check the monitoring tab to see invocation metrics

#### ServiceNowWebhookUrl

This output provides the URL of the API Gateway webhook endpoint that ServiceNow uses to send events to AWS.

**How to use it for validation:**

1. **Verify API Gateway Configuration:**
   - Extract the API ID from the URL: `https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/webhook`
   - Check the API Gateway using AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id <api-id>
     ```

2. **Verify ServiceNow Configuration:**
   - Log in to your ServiceNow instance
   - Navigate to System Web Services > Outbound > REST Messages
   - Find the outbound REST message created by the integration
   - Confirm that the endpoint URL matches the ServiceNowWebhookUrl output

3. **Test the Webhook:**
   - You can send a test request to the webhook URL:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST <ServiceNowWebhookUrl> \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"event_type":"test","incident_number":"INC0010001","short_description":"Test incident"}'
     ```
   - Check the CloudWatch logs for the ServiceNow Notifications Handler Lambda to verify it received the request

### Validating ServiceNow Resources

To validate the resources created in ServiceNow:

1. **Business Rules:**
   - Navigate to System Definition > Business Rules
   - Search for rules with names containing the resource prefix
   - Verify that the following rules exist:
     - **Incident Business Rule**: Monitors the `incident` table for create, update, and delete operations
     - **Attachment Business Rule**: Monitors the `sys_attachment` table for attachment changes on incidents
   - Check that both rules are active and properly configured
   - Verify the script content includes proper event type detection and payload formatting

2. **Outbound REST Messages:**
   - Navigate to System Web Services > Outbound > REST Messages
   - Verify that the REST message is configured with the correct webhook URL
   - Check that the HTTP method is set to POST

3. **Script Includes:**
   - Navigate to System Definition > Script Includes
   - Look for script includes related to the AWS integration
   - Verify they contain the correct formatting logic for incident data

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Prepare ServiceNow**:
   - Ensure you have a ServiceNow instance with admin access
   - Create a dedicated service account for the integration if needed

2. **Deploy the Stack**:
   ```bash
   # Using the deploy-integrations-solution script
   deploy-integrations-solution service-now \
     --instance-id <your-servicenow-instance-id> \
     --username <your-servicenow-username> \
     --password <your-servicenow-password> \
     --log-level info
   ```
   
   Note: The `--log-level` parameter is optional and defaults to `error`. Valid values are `info`, `debug`, and `error`.

3. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - The ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda will automatically:
     - Create business rules in ServiceNow to detect incident changes
     - Configure outbound REST messages to send data to the API Gateway
     - Set up the webhook URL in ServiceNow

4. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Check CloudFormation outputs for the webhook URL
   - Verify in ServiceNow that the business rules and outbound REST messages were created
   - The business rules will be prefixed with the Lambda function name for easy identification

5. **Test the Integration**:
   - Create a test incident in ServiceNow
   - Verify that the incident appears in AWS Security Incident Response
   - Update the incident in AWS and verify the changes appear in ServiceNow

## Security Considerations

- All credentials are stored securely in SSM Parameter Store
- IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- API Gateway is configured with CORS to control access
- CloudWatch logging is enabled for all Lambda functions
