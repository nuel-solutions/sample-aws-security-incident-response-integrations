## Setup and Configuration

1. **Prepare ServiceNow**:
   - Ensure you have a ServiceNow instance with admin access
   - Create a dedicated service account for the integration if needed

2. **Deploy the Stack**:
   ```bash
   # Using the deploy-integrations-solution script with JWT OAuth
   deploy-integrations-solution service-now \
     --instance-id <your-servicenow-instance-id> \
     --client-id <your-oauth-client-id> \
     --client-secret <your-oauth-client-secret> \
     --user-id <your-servicenow-user-id> \
     --private-key-path <path-to-private-key-file> \
     --integration-module <itsm|ir> \
     --log-level info
   ```
   
   **Required Parameters:**
   - `--client-id`: OAuth client ID from ServiceNow OAuth application
   - `--client-secret`: OAuth client secret from ServiceNow OAuth application
   - `--user-id`: ServiceNow user ID for JWT authentication
   - `--private-key-path`: Path to RSA private key file for JWT signing
   - `--integration-module`: Choose `itsm` for IT Service Management or `ir` for Incident Response module
   
   **Optional Parameters:**
   - `--log-level`: Defaults to `error`. Valid values are `info`, `debug`, and `error`

3. **Automatic Configuration**:
   - The ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda will automatically:
     - Create business rules in ServiceNow to detect incident changes
     - Configure outbound REST messages to send data to the API Gateway
     - Set up the webhook URL in ServiceNow

4. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Check CloudFormation outputs for the webhook URL
   - Verify in ServiceNow that the business rules and outbound REST messages were created
   - The business rules will be prefixed with the Lambda function name for easy identification

5. **Test the Integration**:
   - Create a test incident in ServiceNow
   - Verify that the incident appears in AWS Security Incident Response
   - Update the incident in AWS and verify the changes appear in ServiceNow

## Outputs and Validation

After deploying the stack, you'll receive CloudFormation outputs that can be used to validate and troubleshoot the integration.

### Using CloudFormation Outputs

#### ServiceNowClientLambdaArn

This output provides the ARN of the ServiceNow Client Lambda function.

**How to use it for validation:**

1. **Verify Lambda Function Existence:**
   ```bash
   aws lambda get-function --function-name <ServiceNowClientLambdaArn>
   ```

2. **Check Lambda Logs:**
   ```bash
   # Get the function name from the ARN
   FUNCTION_NAME=$(echo <ServiceNowClientLambdaArn> | cut -d':' -f7)
   aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/$FUNCTION_NAME" --limit 10
   ```

3. **Monitor Function Invocations:**
   - Navigate to the Lambda console
   - Search for the function using the ARN
   - Check the monitoring tab to see invocation metrics

#### ServiceNowWebhookUrl

This output provides the URL of the API Gateway webhook endpoint that ServiceNow uses to send events to AWS.

**How to use it for validation:**

1. **Verify API Gateway Configuration:**
   - Extract the API ID from the URL: `https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/webhook`
   - Check the API Gateway using AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id <api-id>
     ```

2. **Verify ServiceNow Configuration:**
   - Log in to your ServiceNow instance
   - Navigate to System Web Services > Outbound > REST Messages
   - Find the outbound REST message created by the integration
   - Confirm that the endpoint URL matches the ServiceNowWebhookUrl output

3. **Test the Webhook:**
   - You can send a test request to the webhook URL:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST <ServiceNowWebhookUrl> \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"event_type":"test","incident_number":"INC0010001","short_description":"Test incident"}'
     ```
   - Check the CloudWatch logs for the ServiceNow Notifications Handler Lambda to verify it received the request

### Validating ServiceNow Resources

To validate the resources created in ServiceNow:

1. **Business Rules:**
   - Navigate to System Definition > Business Rules
   - Search for rules with names containing the resource prefix
   - Verify that the following rules exist:
     - **Incident Business Rule**: Monitors the appropriate table (`incident` for ITSM or `sn_si_incident` for IR) for create, update, and delete operations
     - **Attachment Business Rule**: Monitors the `sys_attachment` table for attachment changes on incidents
   - Check that both rules are active and properly configured
   - Verify the script content includes proper event type detection and payload formatting

2. **Outbound REST Messages:**
   - Navigate to System Web Services > Outbound > REST Messages
   - Verify that the REST message is configured with the correct webhook URL
   - Check that the HTTP method is set to POST

3. **Script Includes:**
   - Navigate to System Definition > Script Includes
   - Look for script includes related to the AWS integration
   - Verify they contain the correct formatting logic for incident data

## JWT OAuth Authentication

The ServiceNow integration uses JWT OAuth authentication for secure API access. This section covers JWT-specific setup and troubleshooting.

### JWT Authentication Flow

1. **JWT Generation**: Lambda functions generate signed JWT tokens using the RSA private key
2. **OAuth Token Exchange**: JWT tokens are exchanged for OAuth access tokens from ServiceNow
3. **API Access**: OAuth access tokens are used for ServiceNow API calls
4. **Token Refresh**: Access tokens are automatically refreshed when expired

### JWT Token Structure

The JWT tokens include:
- **Issuer (iss)**: OAuth client ID
- **Subject (sub)**: ServiceNow user ID  
- **Audience (aud)**: OAuth client ID
- **Issued At (iat)**: Token generation timestamp
- **Expiration (exp)**: Token expiration (1 hour from generation)
- **JWT ID (jti)**: Unique token identifier

### RSA Key Management

- **Private Key**: Stored as S3 asset, referenced via SSM parameters
- **Public Key**: Configured in ServiceNow OAuth application
- **Key Format**: RSA 2048-bit keys in PEM format
- **Security**: Private key never exposed in logs or environment variables

## Security Considerations

- OAuth credentials are stored securely in SSM Parameter Store
- RSA private key is stored as encrypted S3 asset
- JWT tokens have short expiration times (1 hour)
- IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege
- API Gateway is configured with CORS to control access
- CloudWatch logging is enabled for all Lambda functions (sensitive data excluded)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **ServiceNow Resource Setup Fails**:
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for the ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda
   - Verify the ServiceNow OAuth credentials (client ID and client secret) are correct
   - Ensure the ServiceNow user has sufficient permissions to create business rules and REST messages
   - Verify the OAuth application is properly configured in ServiceNow with the correct public key
   - Check that the ServiceNow instance is accessible from AWS Lambda
   - Verify the API Gateway webhook URL is properly formatted

2. **Integration Module Configuration Issues**:
   - Verify the correct `--integration-module` parameter was used during deployment (`itsm` or `ir`)
   - Check that business rules are targeting the correct table (`incident` for ITSM, `sn_si_incident` for IR)
   - Ensure field mappings are appropriate for the selected integration module
   - Verify closure code handling is only applied for ITSM module

3. **Attachment Synchronization Issues**:

#### JWT Debugging Steps

1. **Check JWT Generation**:
   ```bash
   # Look for JWT generation logs
   aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/SecurityIncidentResponseServiceNowClient" --filter-pattern "JWT"
   ```

2. **Verify OAuth Token Exchange**:
   ```bash
   # Check OAuth access token retrieval
   aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/SecurityIncidentResponseServiceNowClient" --filter-pattern "OAuth"
   ```

3. **Validate Private Key Access**:
   ```bash
   # Check S3 private key access logs
   aws logs filter-log-events --log-group-name "/aws/lambda/SecurityIncidentResponseServiceNowClient" --filter-pattern "private key"
   ```
