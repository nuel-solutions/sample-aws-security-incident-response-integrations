# ServiceNow Integration for AWS Security Incident Response

This document provides an overview of the AWS Security Incident Response ServiceNow integration, including its architecture, resources, parameters, and deployment instructions.

## Deployment

```bash
# Deploy the integration with a single command
./deploy-integrations-solution.py service-now \
  --instance-id <your-servicenow-instance-id> \
  --username <your-servicenow-username> \
  --password <your-servicenow-password> \
  --integration-module <itsm|ir> \
  --log-level info
```

### Integration Module Options

- **`itsm`**: IT Service Management module - Uses standard ServiceNow incident table (`incident`)
- **`ir`**: Incident Response module - Uses ServiceNow Security Incident Response table (`sn_si_incident`)

See the Prerequisites section below for instructions on how to obtain your ServiceNow instance id, username and password, configure aws profile, and install necessary tools required to deploy the integration.

## Prerequisites

### Identify Your ServiceNow Instance ID

1. Open your ServiceNow instance in a web browser
2. Look at the URL in your browser's address bar
3. The instance ID is the subdomain part of the URL

**Example:**
- URL: `https://dev12345.service-now.com`
- Instance ID: `dev12345`

### Create a ServiceNow Integration User

1. Log in to your ServiceNow instance as an administrator
2. Navigate to User Administration > Users
3. Click "New" to create a new user
4. Fill in the required fields:
   - User ID: `aws_integration` (recommended)
   - First Name: `AWS`
   - Last Name: `Integration`
   - Password: Create a secure password
5. Assign the following roles:
   - `admin` (or a custom role with permissions to create business rules)
   - `incident_manager`

**Best Practice:** Create a dedicated service account rather than using a personal account.

### Integration Flow

The ServiceNow integration follows a similar pattern to the Jira integration, but with some key differences in implementation:

#### Flow 1: AWS Security Incident Response to ServiceNow

1. The **Security IR Poller Lambda** polls for incidents from AWS Security Incident Response
2. Events are published to EventBridge
3. The **ServiceNow Client Lambda** processes these events
4. The ServiceNow Client Lambda updates or creates incidents in ServiceNow via the ServiceNow API

#### Flow 2: ServiceNow to AWS Security Incident Response

1. ServiceNow incidents trigger a **Business Rule** when created, updated, or closed
2. The Business Rule sends the incident data to an **API Gateway webhook endpoint**
3. The **ServiceNow Notifications Handler Lambda** processes the webhook request and publishes events to EventBridge
4. The **Security IR Client Lambda** subscribes to these events and performs the appropriate operations in AWS Security Incident Response

#### Automatic ServiceNow Setup

The integration includes a **ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda** that automatically configures the necessary components in ServiceNow during deployment:
- Business Rules for incident events
- Outbound REST Messages for API communication
- Script Includes for data formatting



## Resources

### AWS Resources

The ServiceNow integration stack creates the following AWS resources:

### Lambda Functions

1. **ServiceNow Client Lambda** (`SecurityIncidentResponseServiceNowClient`)
   - Processes events from AWS Security Incident Response
   - Creates or updates incidents in ServiceNow
   - Timeout: 15 minutes

2. **ServiceNow Notifications Handler Lambda** (`ServiceNowNotificationsHandler`)
   - Processes webhook events from ServiceNow
   - Publishes events to EventBridge

3. **ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda** (`ServiceNowResourceSetupLambda`)
   - Sets up required resources in ServiceNow during deployment:
     - **Business Rules**: Creates or updates business rules in ServiceNow that trigger when incidents are created, updated, or deleted
     - **Outbound REST Messages**: Configures REST messages that send incident data to the API Gateway webhook
   - Automatically configures the webhook URL in ServiceNow to point to the API Gateway endpoint
   - Runs as a Custom Resource during CloudFormation deployment
   - Timeout: 5 minutes
   - Uses the ServiceNow API to create these components programmatically
   - Uses the API Gateway's REST API ID as a prefix for ServiceNow resource names
   - Environment variables include:
     - `SERVICE_NOW_INSTANCE_ID`: SSM parameter name for the ServiceNow instance ID
     - `SERVICE_NOW_USER`: SSM parameter name for the ServiceNow user
     - `SERVICE_NOW_PASSWORD_PARAM`: SSM parameter name for the ServiceNow password
     - `SERVICE_NOW_RESOURCE_PREFIX`: API Gateway REST API ID

     - `LOG_LEVEL`: Log level for the Lambda function

### API Gateway

- **ServiceNow Webhook API** (`ServiceNowWebhookApi`)
  - Provides an endpoint for ServiceNow to send events
  - Supports POST method (OPTIONS method is automatically added by CORS configuration)
  - Integrates with the ServiceNow Notifications Handler Lambda
  - Configured with CORS support for all origins and methods

### EventBridge Rules

1. **Service Now Client Rule** (`service-now-client-rule`)
   - Captures events from AWS Security Incident Response
   - Triggers the ServiceNow Client Lambda

2. **ServiceNow Notifications Rule** (`ServiceNowNotificationsRule`)
   - Captures events from ServiceNow
   - Logs events to CloudWatch

### SSM Parameters

- `/SecurityIncidentResponse/serviceNowInstanceId`
- `/SecurityIncidentResponse/serviceNowUser`
- `/SecurityIncidentResponse/serviceNowPassword`

### IAM Roles

- Custom roles for each Lambda function with least privilege permissions

### DynamoDB Table

- Uses a shared table from the common stack to store incident mapping information

### ServiceNow Resources

The ServiceNow Resource Setup Lambda creates the following components in your ServiceNow instance:

1. **Business Rules**:
   - **Incident Business Rule**: Triggers when incidents are created, updated, or deleted in ServiceNow
     - Monitors the `incident` table
     - Sends `IncidentCreated` or `IncidentUpdated` events to AWS
     - Includes incident number and system ID in the payload
   - **Attachment Business Rule**: Triggers when attachments are added, updated, or deleted on incidents
     - Monitors the `sys_attachment` table for incident-related attachments
     - Sends `IncidentUpdated` events when attachment changes occur
     - Includes attachment action type (added/updated/deleted) in the payload
     - Only processes attachments related to the incident table
   - Rules are prefixed with the resource prefix for easy identification

2. **Outbound REST Messages**:
   - **Primary REST Message**: Handles incident and attachment event notifications
   - **HTTP POST Function**: Configured to send JSON payloads to the API Gateway webhook
   - **Authorization Headers**: Automatically configured with Bearer token authentication
   - **Request Parameters**: Dynamically configured based on the event payload structure

3. **Authentication**:
   - **API Gateway Secret**: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager for secure webhook authentication
   - **Automatic Token Rotation**: Supports token rotation via AWS Secrets Manager
   - **Bearer Token Authentication**: Used for all webhook requests to AWS

## Key Features

### Bidirectional Synchronization

- **ServiceNow to AWS**: ServiceNow incident changes trigger updates in Security IR cases
- **Real-time Updates**: Event-driven architecture ensures near-instantaneous synchronization

### Attachment Handling
- **Size Limits**: Attachments larger than 5MB are handled via comments with download instructions
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing attachment comments before adding new ones
- **Error Handling**: Failed uploads result in informative comments with fallback instructions
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Attachments are synchronized in both directions when possible

### Comment Synchronization
- **Bidirectional Comments**: Comments are synchronized between both systems
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate comments using content matching
- **Update Tags**: Uses system tags to identify and skip system-generated updates
- **Rich Content**: Supports formatted comments and work notes

### Status Mapping
- **Intelligent Mapping**: Maps Security IR case statuses to appropriate ServiceNow incident states
- **Workflow Support**: Handles ServiceNow workflow transitions automatically
- **Closure Handling**: Properly manages incident closure and resolution codes

## Troubleshooting

For detailed troubleshooting information, common issues, and diagnostic steps, please refer to the [ServiceNow Integration Troubleshooting Guide](SERVICE_NOW_TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- ServiceNow credentials are stored securely in SSM Parameter Store
- API Gateway authentication tokens are managed via AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatic token rotation is supported for enhanced security

### Network Security
- All communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption
- API Gateway endpoints are secured with custom authorizers
- ServiceNow webhook requests include proper authentication headers

### Access Control
- Lambda functions use least-privilege IAM roles
- ServiceNow integration user should have minimal required permissions
- DynamoDB access is restricted to specific table operations

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Field Mapping
Modify the `service_now_sir_mapper.py` file to customize field mappings between ServiceNow and Security IR:

```python
FIELD_MAPPING = {
    "short_description": "title",
    "description": "description",
    "comments_and_work_notes": "caseComments",
    # Add custom field mappings here
}
```

### Status Mapping Customization
Update the status mapping in `service_now_sir_mapper.py`:

```python
STATUS_MAPPING = {
    "Detection and Analysis": "2",  # In Progress
    "Containment, Eradication and Recovery": "2",  # In Progress
    "Post-incident Activities": "2",  # In Progress
    "Closed": "7",  # Closed
    # Add custom status mappings here
}
```

### Business Rule Customization
The ServiceNow business rules can be customized after deployment by modifying them directly in ServiceNow or by updating the `service_now_resource_setup_handler` code and redeploying.
